The deployment environment is a namespace in a container platform like <Globals name=\"kube\" /> or <Globals name=\"ocp\" />.\nArgo CD models a collection of applications as a project and uses a Git repository to store the application's desired state.\nArgo CD is flexible in the structure of the application configuration represented in the Git repository.\n\nArgo CD supports defining Kubernetes manifests in a number of ways:\n- helm charts\n- kustomize\n- ksonnet\n- jsonnet\n- plain directory of yaml/json manifests\n- custom plugins\n\nArgo CD compares the actual state of the application in the cluster with the desired state defined in Git and determines if\nthey are out of sync. When it detects the environment is out of sync, Argo CD can be configured to either send out a \nnotification to kick off a separate reconciliation process or Argo CD can automatically synchronize the environments to \nensure they match.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Confidential information like passwords and security tokens should not be checked into the Git repository. [Managing secrets in Argo CD](#managing-secrets-in-argo-cd)\nprovides information on how to handle confidential information in the GitOps repo.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Configuring GitOps with Argo CD\n\n**Terminology:**\n\nArgo CD uses a number of terms to refer to the components\n\n- Application - A deployable unit\n\n    In the context of the <Globals name=\"env\" />, an application is one Helm chart that contains one container image\n    that was produced by one CI pipeline. While Helm charts and images could certainly be combined to make more\n    sophisticated applications in more advanced scenarios, we will be using this simple definition here.\n\n- Project - A collection of applications that make up a solution\n\n### Set up the GitOps repo\n\nArgo CD uses a Git repo to express the desired state of the Kubernetes environment. The basic setup uses one\nrepository to represent one [*project*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/projects/). Within that\nrepository, each [*application*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications)\nthat makes up the project will be described in its own folder. The repository will also contain a branch for each\ndestination (i.e. cluster and namespace) into which we want to deploy the applications.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** There is nothing special about a git repository used for git-ops. All that is required at a minimum is a hosted git\nrepository that is accessible from by the Argo CD instance.  The [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate)\nused in the following steps is optional and provides some application templates to help simplify some configuration activities.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n1. Create a new repo from the [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate)\n\n1. Clone the project to your machine and navigate into the directory\n\n1. Create a branch for the environment (e.g. `test` to configure the values for deployment to the testing environment)\n\n    ```shell script\n    git checkout -b test\n    ```\n\n1. Copy the helm chart template into application name folder\n\n    ```shell script\n    cp -r templates/project-config-helm {APPLICATION_NAME}\n    ```\n\n1. Push the test branch up to the repository\n\n    ```shell script\n    git push -u origin test\n    ```\n\n1. Create a corresponding OCP namespace for `test`\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc namespace {TEST_NAMESPACE}\n    ```\n\n1. Grant access to service accounts in the new `test` namespace to pull the container image from the `dev` namespace\n\n    ```shell script\n    oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:{TEST_NAMESPACE} -n {DEV_NAMESPACE}\n    ```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Repeat the last 5 steps above for any other envioronments you wish to deploy to such as staging and production.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline\n\nThe last stage in the CI pipeline updates a GitOps repository with the updated application metadata from the build. In\norder to do that, the CI pipeline needs to know which repository should be used and needs the credentials to push changes\nto that repository. As with other configuration within the pipeline, this is handled with config maps and secrets:\n\n- A secret named `git-credentials` holds the credentials the CI pipeline uses to access all the respositories in the Git host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc).\nIf you used the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to register the pipeline then this secret has already been created.\n- A config map named `gitops-repo` holds the url and branch for the gitops repository.\n\nFortunately the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) provides a `gitops` command to simplify this step. Information on how to use the\ncommand as well as the alternative manual steps can be found in the [IGC CLI gitops command](/getting-started/cli#gitops) section.\n\n1. Run the `gitops` command to create the config map and secret in the CI namespace\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc gitops\n    ```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:**\n\n- For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace where the\npipeline is running.\n- The value provided for `branch` is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger the CD\npipeline.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nAs of v2.0.0 of the Tekton tasks and the Jenkins pipelines, the CI pipeline will create a folder and the initial configuration\nfor an application deployment if it doesn't already exist. This means, there is no other manual configuration required\nto set up the repository.\n\n### Create a project in Argo CD (Optional)\n\nIn Argo CD terms, each deployable component is an application and applications are grouped into projects. Projects are not\nrequired for Argo CD to be able to deploy applications, but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions\non what can be done for applications that make up a project.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD UI\">\n\n1.

The plugin takes yaml \nconfiguration as input, looks up the credentials in Key Protect, and generates a secret in the cluster from the results.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** If Argo CD was installed via the Toolkit then the plugin should already be installed and ready to use. If not, the \ninstructions for installing the plugin can be found in the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect).\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n#### Prepare the Key Protect instance\n\nAs the name suggests, the [Argo CD Key Protect plugin](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect) leverages the\ncapabilities of the Key Protect service to manage the protected information. The details for setting up and\nmanaging the Key Protect instance can be found in [Secret management with Key Protect](/tools/secret-management-with-key-protect). From\nthose instructions you can find the information required for the subsequent steps.\n\n#### Create the secret configuration\n\nThe input to the plugin is a directory that contains one or more yaml \"secret templates\". In this case the \"secret template\" provides the \nstructure of the desired secret with placeholders for the values that will be pulled from the key management system. \n\n1. Create a directory to contain the secret configuration. The [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops) repository has a template in `templates/secrets-plugin` that can be copied as a starting point\n\n2. Update the values in the yaml file for the secret that will be created\n\n    ```yaml\n    apiVersion: keymanagement.ibm/v1\n    kind: SecretTemplate\n    metadata:\n      name: mysecret\n      annotations:\n        key-manager: key-protect\n        key-protect/instanceId: instance-id\n        key-protect/region: us-east\n    spec:\n      labels: {}\n      annotations: {}\n      values:\n        - name: url\n          value: https://ibm.com\n        - name: username\n          b64value: dGVhbS1jYXA=\n        - name: password\n          keyId: 36397b07-d98d-4c0b-bd7a-d6c290163684\n    ``` \n    \n    - The `metadata.annotations` value is optional. \n    \n        - `key-manager` - the only value supported currently is `key-protect`\n        - `key-protect/instanceId` - the instance id of the key protect instance. If not provided then the `instance-id` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.\n        - `key-protect/region` - the region where the key protect instance has been provisioned. If not provided then the `region` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.\n        \n    - The `metadata.name` value given will be used as the name for the Secret that will be generated.\n    - The information in `spec.labels` and `spec.annotations` will be copied over as the `labels` and `annotations` in the Secret that is generated\n    - The `spec.values` section contains the information that should be provided in the `data` section of the generated Secret. There are three prossible ways the values can be provided:\n    \n        - `value` - the actual value can be provided directly as clear text. This would be appropriate for information that is not sensitive but is required in the secret\n        - `b64value` - a base64 encoded value can be provided to the secret. This can be used for large values that might present formatting issues or for information that is not sensitive but that might be obfuscated a bit (like a username)\n        - `keyId` - the id (not the name) of the Standard Key that has been stored in Key Protect. The value stored in Key Protect can be anything\n\n3. Commit the changes to the GitOps repository\n\n#### Add the secret application in Argo CD\n\nOnce the configuration has been added to the GitOps repository, Argo CD needs to be configured to deploy the secrets.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD UI\">\n\n1. Log into Argo CD user interface\n\n1. Press `New Application` and provide the following values:\n\n    - `application name` - The name of the application. It is recommend to use the format of `{namespace}-{image name}`\n    - `project` - The project with which the application should be included\n    - `sync-policy` - The manner with which Argo CD will use to manage the deployed artifacts. `Automatic` is\n    recommended\n    - `repository url` - The Git url where the configuration is stored\n    - `revision` - The branch where the configuration for this instance is stored\n    - `path` - The path within the repository where the application config is located (should be the application name)\n    - `destination cluster` - The cluster url for the deployment\n    - `destination namespace` - The namespace where the application should be deployed\n    - `Plugin` - In the last section of the UI select `Plugin` from the dropdown\n        ![Argo CD plugin](/images/argocd-plugin.png)\n    - `key-protect-secret` - Click in the name field and select `key-protect-secret` from the dropdown\n        ![Argo CD key protect secret](/images/argocd-key-protect-secret.png)\n\n1. Repeat that step for each secret application and environment\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD CLI\">\n\n1.

To do that,\nthe target cluster must first be registered with Argo CD. After that, the cluster api server can be selected as a\ndeployment target within an application configuration. The following describes the steps required to add another cluster\nas a deployment target:\n\n1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On <Global name=\"ocp\" /> this is the same as the UI host\n    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for\n    the username and password\n\n    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command\n\n2. Log into the target cluster from the command line\n\n3. Run the Argo CD command to list the available clusters\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster add\n    ```\n\n    The currently selected cluster will be the one with the asterisk next to it. Copy the cluster id from the table\n\n4. Add the cluster to Argo CD\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster add {CLUSTER ID}\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    - `{CLUSTER ID}` is the id of the target cluster from the previous step\n\n5.

Within that\nrepository, each [*application*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications)\nthat makes up the project will be described in its own folder. The repository will also contain a branch for each\ndestination (i.e. cluster and namespace) into which we want to deploy the applications.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** There is nothing special about a git repository used for git-ops. All that is required at a minimum is a hosted git\nrepository that is accessible from by the Argo CD instance.  The [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate)\nused in the following steps is optional and provides some application templates to help simplify some configuration activities.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n1. Create a new repo from the [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate)\n\n1. Clone the project to your machine and navigate into the directory\n\n1. Create a branch for the environment (e.g. `test` to configure the values for deployment to the testing environment)\n\n    ```shell script\n    git checkout -b test\n    ```\n\n1. Copy the helm chart template into application name folder\n\n    ```shell script\n    cp -r templates/project-config-helm {APPLICATION_NAME}\n    ```\n\n1. Push the test branch up to the repository\n\n    ```shell script\n    git push -u origin test\n    ```\n\n1. Create a corresponding OCP namespace for `test`\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc namespace {TEST_NAMESPACE}\n    ```\n\n1. Grant access to service accounts in the new `test` namespace to pull the container image from the `dev` namespace\n\n    ```shell script\n    oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:{TEST_NAMESPACE} -n {DEV_NAMESPACE}\n    ```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Repeat the last 5 steps above for any other envioronments you wish to deploy to such as staging and production.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline\n\nThe last stage in the CI pipeline updates a GitOps repository with the updated application metadata from the build. In\norder to do that, the CI pipeline needs to know which repository should be used and needs the credentials to push changes\nto that repository. As with other configuration within the pipeline, this is handled with config maps and secrets:\n\n- A secret named `git-credentials` holds the credentials the CI pipeline uses to access all the respositories in the Git host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc).\nIf you used the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to register the pipeline then this secret has already been created.\n- A config map named `gitops-repo` holds the url and branch for the gitops repository.\n\nFortunately the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) provides a `gitops` command to simplify this step. Information on how to use the\ncommand as well as the alternative manual steps can be found in the [IGC CLI gitops command](/getting-started/cli#gitops) section.\n\n1. Run the `gitops` command to create the config map and secret in the CI namespace\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc gitops\n    ```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:**\n\n- For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace where the\npipeline is running.\n- The value provided for `branch` is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger the CD\npipeline.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nAs of v2.0.0 of the Tekton tasks and the Jenkins pipelines, the CI pipeline will create a folder and the initial configuration\nfor an application deployment if it doesn't already exist. This means, there is no other manual configuration required\nto set up the repository.\n\n### Create a project in Argo CD (Optional)\n\nIn Argo CD terms, each deployable component is an application and applications are grouped into projects. Projects are not\nrequired for Argo CD to be able to deploy applications, but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions\non what can be done for applications that make up a project.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD UI\">\n\n1.

The plugin takes yaml \nconfiguration as input, looks up the credentials in Key Protect, and generates a secret in the cluster from the results.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** If Argo CD was installed via the Toolkit then the plugin should already be installed and ready to use. If not, the \ninstructions for installing the plugin can be found in the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect).\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n#### Prepare the Key Protect instance\n\nAs the name suggests, the [Argo CD Key Protect plugin](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect) leverages the\ncapabilities of the Key Protect service to manage the protected information. The details for setting up and\nmanaging the Key Protect instance can be found in [Secret management with Key Protect](/tools/secret-management-with-key-protect). From\nthose instructions you can find the information required for the subsequent steps.\n\n#### Create the secret configuration\n\nThe input to the plugin is a directory that contains one or more yaml \"secret templates\". In this case the \"secret template\" provides the \nstructure of the desired secret with placeholders for the values that will be pulled from the key management system. \n\n1. Create a directory to contain the secret configuration. The [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops) repository has a template in `templates/secrets-plugin` that can be copied as a starting point\n\n2. Update the values in the yaml file for the secret that will be created\n\n    ```yaml\n    apiVersion: keymanagement.ibm/v1\n    kind: SecretTemplate\n    metadata:\n      name: mysecret\n      annotations:\n        key-manager: key-protect\n        key-protect/instanceId: instance-id\n        key-protect/region: us-east\n    spec:\n      labels: {}\n      annotations: {}\n      values:\n        - name: url\n          value: https://ibm.com\n        - name: username\n          b64value: dGVhbS1jYXA=\n        - name: password\n          keyId: 36397b07-d98d-4c0b-bd7a-d6c290163684\n    ``` \n    \n    - The `metadata.annotations` value is optional. \n    \n        - `key-manager` - the only value supported currently is `key-protect`\n        - `key-protect/instanceId` - the instance id of the key protect instance. If not provided then the `instance-id` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.\n        - `key-protect/region` - the region where the key protect instance has been provisioned. If not provided then the `region` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.\n        \n    - The `metadata.name` value given will be used as the name for the Secret that will be generated.\n    - The information in `spec.labels` and `spec.annotations` will be copied over as the `labels` and `annotations` in the Secret that is generated\n    - The `spec.values` section contains the information that should be provided in the `data` section of the generated Secret. There are three prossible ways the values can be provided:\n    \n        - `value` - the actual value can be provided directly as clear text. This would be appropriate for information that is not sensitive but is required in the secret\n        - `b64value` - a base64 encoded value can be provided to the secret. This can be used for large values that might present formatting issues or for information that is not sensitive but that might be obfuscated a bit (like a username)\n        - `keyId` - the id (not the name) of the Standard Key that has been stored in Key Protect. The value stored in Key Protect can be anything\n\n3. Commit the changes to the GitOps repository\n\n#### Add the secret application in Argo CD\n\nOnce the configuration has been added to the GitOps repository, Argo CD needs to be configured to deploy the secrets.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD UI\">\n\n1.

To do that,\nthe target cluster must first be registered with Argo CD. After that, the cluster api server can be selected as a\ndeployment target within an application configuration. The following describes the steps required to add another cluster\nas a deployment target:\n\n1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On <Global name=\"ocp\" /> this is the same as the UI host\n    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for\n    the username and password\n\n    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command\n\n2. Log into the target cluster from the command line\n\n3. Run the Argo CD command to list the available clusters\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster add\n    ```\n\n    The currently selected cluster will be the one with the asterisk next to it. Copy the cluster id from the table\n\n4. Add the cluster to Argo CD\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster add {CLUSTER ID}\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    - `{CLUSTER ID}` is the id of the target cluster from the previous step\n\n5. Confirm the configuration by listing the known clusters\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster list\n    ```\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/ibm-garage-developer-guide/ibm-garage-developer-guide/src/pages/tools/argocd/index.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1054721580","1054721580","1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","3273249464","768070550"]}
