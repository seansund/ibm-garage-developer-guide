These are the getting started and initial setup tasks that help you start a project.\n\n| Task                            | Description         | Link        | Time    |\n| --------------------------------| ------------------  |:----------- |---------|\n| Prerequisites | Install the prerequisite tools  | [Install Prerequisites](/getting-started/prereqs) | 1 hr |\n| Validate Access | Validate access to your Cloud Account and your Development Cluster |  [Validate](/homework/teams) | 15 min |\n| Developer Guide | Read the Developer Guide cover-to-cover if you can | [Developer Guide](/overview) | 30 min |\n| Deploy your first app | The very first experience of deploying an app in OpenShift or Kubernetes | [Deploy First App](/getting-started/deploy-app) | 10-30 min |\n| Inventory Micro App, Part 1 | Creating the Inventory Service with Java | [Inventory Part 1 - Service](/practical/inventory-part1#) | 45 min |\n| Inventory Micro App, Part 1 | Creating the Inventory BFF with GraphQL | [Inventory Part 1 - BFF](/practical/inventory-part1#inventory-bff) | 30 min |\n| Inventory Micro App, Part 1 | Adding Cloud Database to you Inventory Service | [Inventory Part 1 - User Interface](/practical/inventory-part1#inventory-ui) | 30 min |\n| **Bonus Credit** | Complete Inventory Part 1 using the Kubernetes cluster in your team's resource group | [Part 1 Exercise](/practical/inventory-part1) | 1 hr |\n\n### Homework Review Week 1\n\nThe homework review will take the form of a retrospective for the attendees who have completed the homework tasks. We are looking for feedback from three perspectives:\n\n- **What went well?**\n- **What needs improvement?**\n- **Next steps?**\n\nStudents will begin this **MOOC** with different skill levels and familiarity with this material, but will complete the MOOC ready to perform a Garage engagement. Each student's **Next Steps** will help identify that person's skill gaps to ensure they cover the topics needed to complete the **MOOC** successfully.\n\nPlease use the [online retrospective](https://reetro-io.herokuapp.com/board/5dc4fca0074a5400170d9c93/5dc4fca0074a5400170d9c95) board during the live Homework session to evaluate the session. As students enter feedback, we'll all be able to see it on this shared screen.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"7a263913e0cef3937d6345171e7d4bc3","counter":959,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MOOC Homework Session 1, Week 1"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: MOOC Homework Session 1, Week 1\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nHomework for students in the MOOC, Session 1 Part 1\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nThis is the homework tasks for the [Garage OpenShift and Cloud Pak MOOC](/homework/teams).
