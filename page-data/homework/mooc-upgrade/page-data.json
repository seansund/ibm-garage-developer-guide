This is to enable the\n  MOOC to continue into 2020. The decision was made not to migrate\n   data at this point as it is a living breathing learning platform so can be cleared down at the discretion of the enablement team.\n\nThe good news is all your apps are stored in your teams Git Organization so will not be effected. The following is a list of steps to enable your existing apps to be redeployed. \n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note**: If you have not completed any MOOC Education activities you are not\n effected.
