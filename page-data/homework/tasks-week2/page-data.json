Day 1 focuses on being able to use the environment well enough to develop and deploy a basic cloud-native application. Day 2 focuses on using the SDLC to iteratively develop, deliver, operate, secure, and manage applications. As a team executes the key agile ceremonies using the [Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/cloud/), it's important for developers and architects to understand what is involved in moving software components consistently and reliably from *dev* to *test* and on to *production*. A good understanding of common Day 2 activities is a critical skill for cloud-native development teams.\n\nThis week's homework involves a number of tasks that are more advanced than those from week 1, so take your time and do some research on the topic before jumping into the task.\n\n| Task                            | Description         | Link        | Time    |\n| --------------------------------| ------------------  |:----------- |---------|\n| Re-read the Developer Guide| There have been updates from the first week. Focus on Tools Guides for the homework below and the guides for Inventory Micro App Part 1 and 2. | [Developer Guide](/overview) | 30 min |\n| Review your image registry | Using the Image Registry guide, follow the _Give it a try_ section |[Image Registry](/tools/image-registry#give-it-a-try) | 15 mins |\n| Review your app's code quality | Using the SonarQube guide, follow the _Give it a try_ section |[Code Analysis](/tools/code-analysis#give-it-a-try) | 30 mins |\n| View your app's logs | Using the LogDNA guide, follow the _Give it a try_ section | [Log Management](/tools/log-management#give-it-a-try) | 20 min |\n| Monitor your app | Using the SysDig guide, follow the _Give it a try_ section | [Monitoring](/tools/monitoring#give-it-a-try) | 30 min |\n| Inventory Micro App, Part 2 | Using GitOps to deploy your Inventory app's components to `test` | [Inventory Part 2 - CD](/practical/inventory-part2#using-cd-to-deliver-to-test) | 45 min |\n| Inventory Micro App, Part 2 | Secure your Inventory app | [Inventory Part 2 - Secure App](/practical/inventory-part2#securing-the-solution-with-app-id) | 30 min |\n| Inventory Micro App, Part 2 | Add a cloud database to you Inventory service | [Inventory Part 2 - Database](/practical/inventory-part2#add-a-cloudant-integration-to-your-backend-service) | 45 min |\n| Install Dev tools on CRC | Install and configure the Developer Tools into Red Hat CodeReady Containers | [Install CRC](/admin/installation-crc) | 1 hr |\n\n\nOnce you have completed these tasks, you will have completed the homework for both the Day 1 Developer Experience and the Day 2 Developer Experience. For Day 1, you created your first app and CI pipeline, and then extended that into a 3-tier polyglot solution. For Day 2, you worked with your application's logs, monitored your app, and moved your code from *dev* to *test*.\n\nWhat is very clear is that the Developer Tools envionment--an application architeture that combines a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster with powerful cloud services, packaged with a development environment with a CI/CD pipeline incorporating best-of-breed open source tools--gives you a powerful development platform that enables you to build any form of cloud-native application. These skills form the foundation not only to develop applications for Kubernetes and OpenShift, but to develop applications that leverage the IBM Cloud Paks as well. Keep an out for the *IBM Cloud Pak Developers Guide*, coming in 2020.\n\n### Homework Review Week 2\n\nThe homework review will take the form of a show-and-tell and a retrospective. The show-and-tell includes a description of tasks that didn't go so well. It will close with a retrospective for the attendees who have completed the homework tasks. We are looking for feedback from three perspectives:\n\n- **What went well?**\n- **What needs improvement?**\n- **Next steps?**\n\nPlease use the [online retrospective](https://reetro-io.herokuapp.com/board/5dc4fca0074a5400170d9c93/5dd0c5f09e2836001750eeb3) board during the live Homework session to evaluate the session.
