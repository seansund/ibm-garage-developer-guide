To set your email address in GitHub:\n- Go to [Github](https://github.com) (public, not enterprise)\n- Log into your account or create one\n- Navigate to you account settings\n- Select emails, check your IBM email address is your primary email for the account\n- If it is not, then add you IBM email and verify it\n- If you are correctly verified and associated, you will receive a second email inviting you to your team's GitHub organization\n\n![GitHub eMail](githubemail.png)\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n**Warning:** If you do not associate your IBM email with you public GitHub account, you will not receive\na Git Organization invite and you will have issues completing the homework.

It includes an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster, cloud services bound to the cluster, and developer tools installed in the cluster. The combination supports developing cloud-native microservices architecture applications and CI/CD continuous deployment of those applications. A development team creating an application for a company would install one of these environments in the company's IBM Cloud account. Multiple development teams creating applications for the same company would install multiple environments, one per team wanting to work independently.\n\nThe Sandbox has been defined exactly how a client of IBM would use the IBM Cloud. Each development team will contain up to **100+** of your IBM colleagues. Each team has been configured in [IAM](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam) as its own access group with a corresponding resource group. Your resources for your team's Developer Tools environment have been created in that resource group. As a member of your team's access group, you'll have access to the resources in your team's Developer Tools environment. Since the Developer Tools environment has already been created, you are restricted from creating new cloud resources or deleting existing ones.\n\nThe following teams diagram shows how access is configured. Imagine you are the Green user: There will be lots of other users in your team, maybe in different timezones, all sharing the same cloud resources. The administrators will monitor the cluster to identify any issues early and resolve them.\n\n![MOOC Teams](moocteams.png)\n\nYou will be given access to the team's GitHub organization and are expected to create all of your applications as repositories in your team's organization. This is how real world development projects work. This enables you to collaborate with your fellow team members and  prevents you from creating duplicate projects names.\n\n**Extra credit**: After performing the homework in the OpenShift cluster, can you get it working in a Kubernetes cluster as well? As shown in the teams diagram above, your team's Developer Tools environment and its resource group include not only an OpenShift cluster but also a Kubernetes cluster. It's helpful if you can perform these development tasks in both container platforms because some IBM clients use one and some use the other. If you can work in both, you'll be qualified to staff more projects. The Developer Tools environment makes the developer experience the same for both container platforms.\n\n<p/>\n\n## Team locations\n\nThe teams are spread globally in different geographic locations listed below.
