It is designed to help you navigate\nto the installed tools and provide a simple way to perform common developer tasks, such as:\n- **Dashboard**: Navigate to the tools installed in the cluster\n- **Activation**: Links to education to help you learn cloud-native development and deployment using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud\n- **<Globals name=\"templates\" />**: Links to templates that will help accelerate your project\n\nWith the release of **<Globals name=\"ocp\" /> 4.x**, it is now even easier for developers to integrate the SDLC tools into the OpenShift console. This Developer Dashboard is mainly focused on providing a simple navigation experience when the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> is installed into <Globals name=\"iks\" />.\n\n![Developer Dashboard](/images/developer-dashboard.png)\n\nHere are some recent improvements:\n- More tools can be added to the dashboard using a simple `igc tool-config` command\n- Prefix (shown above as \"IBM\") and Title (shown above as \"Cloud Native Toolkit\") can be customized to you own names\n- The IBM Cloud link can be overidden to support links to other cloud vendors when OpenShift is running on Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, or VMWare\n- The tools view is split into more columns to enable more reuse of the screen\n- The Cluster information is now available when you click on \"Developer Dashboard\" title\n- The <Globals name=\"igccli\" /> now installs an alias into the `oc` and `kubectl` so it is now possible to open the dashboard quickly using `oc dashboard` and `kubectl dashboard`\n\n### Tools configured with OpenShift console\n\nWhen the administrator configures your <Globals name=\"devenv\" />, they can customize a set of short cut links to common\ntools you often use as a developer.\n\n![OpenShift Links](/images/openshift-console-tools.png)\n\nYou can see how these tools are configured by reading the [tools configuration guide](/admin/config-dashboard)\n\n### Opening the Dashboard\n\nYou can open the Dashboard from a terminal.\n\n1. Open a terminal\n2. Make sure your terminal is logged into your cluster\n    - In the IBM Cloud console, navigate to your cluster's overview\n    - Switch to the **Access** tab\n    - Follow the instructions to log in from the command line\n3. Use the [<Globals name=\"igccli\" />](/getting-started/cli#dashboard) to open the Dashboard in your environment\n\n    <Tabs>\n    <Tab label=\"OpenShift\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    oc dashboard\n    ```\n    </Tab>\n    <Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    kubectl dashboard\n    ```\n    </Tab>\n    <Tab label=\"IGC\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc dashboard\n    ```\n    </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\n    The command should print the url to the dashboard then open the default browser to the url.\n\n### Opening the Kubernetes/OpenShift console\n\n- Use the [<Globals name=\"igccli\" />](/getting-started/cli) `console` command to open the IKS or OpenShift console:\n\n    <Tabs>\n    <Tab label=\"OpenShift\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    oc console\n    ```\n\n    </Tab>\n    <Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    kubectl console\n    ```\n\n    </Tab>\n    <Tab label=\"IGC\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc console\n    ```\n\n    </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\n    This command will determine the type of cluster (IKS or OpenShift), get the url for the console, and launch\n    the url in the default browser. If the default browser is not available then the url will be printed to the\n    screen.\n\n### Access the URLs to endpoints in the cluster\n\n- Use the [<Globals name=\"igccli\" />](/getting-started/cli) `endpoints` command to list the endpoints for a given namespace/project:\n\n    <Tabs>\n    <Tab label=\"OpenShift\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    oc endpoints -n tools\n    ```\n\n    </Tab>\n    <Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    kubectl endpoints -n tools\n    ```\n\n    </Tab>\n    <Tab label=\"IGC\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc endpoints -n tools\n    ```\n\n    </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\n    This will return the route and ingress URLs for the `tools` namespace where the DevOps tools have been installed in the cluster:\n    ```shell script\n    ? Endpoints in the 'tools' namespace. Select an endpoint to launch the default browser or 'Exit'.\n\n     1) Exit\n     2) developer-dashboard - http://dashboard.garage-dev-ocp4-c-518489-0143c5dd31acd8e030a1d6e0ab1380e3-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud\n     3) argocd-server - https://argocd-tools.gsi-learning-ocp311-clu-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0001.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud\n     4) artifactory - https://artifactory-tools.gsi-learning-ocp311-clu-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0001.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud\n     5) dashboard - https://dashboard-tools.gsi-learning-ocp311-clu-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0001.eu-gb.containers.appdomain.cloud\n     6) developer-dashboard - http://dashboard.garage-dev-ocp4-c-518489-0143c5dd31acd8e030a1d6e0ab1380e3-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud\n    (Move up and down to reveal more choices)\n     Answer:\n    ```\n\n    You can then select the URL and launch it in the default browser.\n\n### Credentials\n\nIn the future, the tools in the Dashboard will be linked using a single sign-on (SSO) service. In the meantime, the CLI includes a command to list the tools' logins.\n\n- Use the [<Globals name=\"igccli\" />](/getting-started/cli) `credentials` command to list the endpoints and credentials for the tools\n\n    <Tabs>\n    <Tab label=\"OpenShift\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    oc credentials\n    ```\n    </Tab>\n    <Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    kubectl credentials\n    ```\n    </Tab>\n    <Tab label=\"IGC\">\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc credentials\n    ```\n    </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\n    The command lists the `userid` and `password` for each tool installed.
