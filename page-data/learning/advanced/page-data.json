Developer intermediate focuses on being able to use the environment well enough to develop and deploy a basic cloud-native application. Developer advanced focuses on using the SDLC to iteratively develop, deliver, operate, secure, and manage applications. As a team executes the key agile ceremonies using the [Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/cloud/), it's important for developers and architects to understand what is involved in moving software components consistently and reliably from *dev* to *test* and on to *production*.\n\nThese learning tasks are more advanced than those from the developer intermediate experience, so take your time and do some research on the topic before jumping into the task.\n\n## Before the Workshop\n\nPlease complete these tasks before attending the first session. This will help you get started quickly with the practical exercises.\n\n| Task                            | Description         | Link        | Time    |\n| --------------------------------| ------------------  |:----------- |---------|\n| Prerequisites | Install the prerequisite tools  | [Setup Prerequisites](/getting-started/prereqs) | 10 mins |\n| **Operator Overview** | Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application |<a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/operator/\" target=\"_newwindow\">Operators</a> | 15 min |\n| **Operator Labs** | Developing operator step by step |<a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/operator/lab\" target=\"_newwindow\">Operator Labs</a> | 45 min |\n| **Enhancing Inventory App with managed services** | | | |\n| App ID | Secure the solution with App ID  | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/inventory-appid\" target=\"_newwindow\">App ID</a> | 25 mins |\n| Cloudant | Integrate Backend with Cloudant Database | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/inventory-cloudant\" target=\"_newwindow\">Cloudant</a> | 15 mins |\n| **Continuous Integration** | | | |\n| Overview of pipeline structure (Jenkins & Tekton) | | | |\n| Understanding ConfigMaps and Secrets | | | |\n| Customizing the Jenkins pipeline | | | |\n| Customizing the Tekton pipeline | | | |\n| **Continuous Delivery VSI's** | | | |\n| VPC Overview | | | |\n| Create VSI into a VPC | | | |\n| Deploy an App into a VSI using tekton | | | |\n| **Continuous Delivery** | | | |\n| Continuous Delivery | Overview | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-foundation/continuous-delivery\" target=\"_newwindow\">CD</a> | 15 mins |\n| GitOps with ArgoCD | Overview | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/gitops\" target=\"_newwindow\">GitOps</a> | 15 mins |\n| CD for Inventory App | Enhance Inventory App with CD | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/inventory-cd\" target=\"_newwindow\">CD for Inventory App</a> | 30 mins |\n| **DevSecOps** | | | |\n| DevSecOps | DevSecOps Overview | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/devsecops\" target=\"_newwindow\">DevSecOps</a> | 15 mins |\n| Advanced Container Security | DevSecOps with Aqua CSP | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/devsecops-aquasec-csp\" target=\"_newwindow\">Container Security</a> | 20 mins |\n| Advanced Container Security | DevSecOps with Twistlock | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/devsecops-twistlock\" target=\"_newwindow\">Container Security</a> | 20 mins |\n| Add security to CI/CD | DevSecOps with Trivy | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/devsecops-trivy\" target=\"_newwindow\">Incorporate CI/CD</a> | 30 mins |\n| **Advanced Monitoring and Logging** | | | |\n| Monitoring | Advanced Monitoring with Sysdig | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/monitoring\" target=\"_newwindow\">Advanced Monitoring</a> | 30 mins |\n| Log Management | Advanced Log Management with LogDNA | <a href=\"https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/developer-advanced/log-management\" target=\"_newwindow\">Advanced Log Management</a> | 30 mins |\n| End to End Tracing with Jaeger | | | |\n| **Advanced Microservices Techniques** | | | |\n| Service Mesh | | | |\n| KNative Serverless | | | |\n| Modify inventory application with service mesh | | | |\n| End to end Tracing with Jaeger | | | |\n| Events with Kafka | | | |\n| Contract testing | | | |\n| OpenAPI and Swagger Editor | | | |\n| API Consumption | | | |\n\nOnce you have completed these tasks, you will have completed the learning requirements for both the intermediate and the advanced Experience.
