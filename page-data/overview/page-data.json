It embodies IBM Garage Method principles and practices for consistently developed applications incorporating best practices that increase developer velocity for efficient delivery of business value.\n\n### Overview\n\nThis short video introduces the concepts of DevOps with <Globals name=\"ocp\" />:\n<iframe width=\"80%\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GOPWObjFTsI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p></p>\n\nEach development team installs its own <Globals name=\"env\" /> into the team's account. The environment includes several features that support <Globals name=\"method\" /> best practices for consistent and rapid development of cloud-native applications:\n\n- **Installation**: The <Globals name=\"shortName\"/> is able to install itself as a new <Globals name=\"env\" />\n- **Cluster**: A <Globals name=\"kube\" /> or <Globals name=\"ocp\" /> cluster that both hosts the tools and itself is a deployment target for application builds\n- **SDLC**: Deployment target environments that support the application development lifecycle: *dev*, *test*, and *staging*\n- **Backend services**: Cloud services commonly required by cloud-native applications for monitoring, security, and persistence\n- **CI/CD**: A prebuilt, ready-to-run continuous delivery pipeline incorporating best-of-breed open source software tools\n- **<Globals name=\"templates\" />**: Prebuilt code templates for common application components and tasks incorporating best practices that developers can add to their codebase as needed\n- **Dashboard**: A centralized console to help developers use the environment's capabilities\n- **Red Hat CRC**: The tools can be installed into the RedHat CodeReady Containers environment\n\nA core set of tools are sourced from the [IBM Bitnami Software Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label%3Ahelm#software) that can be found in the <Globals name=\"ic\" />. This approach helps assemble these reliable open source development tools into an end-to-end developer experience that is fully integrated with <Globals name=\"ic\" />'s managed container orchestration services.\n\nTypically a [Cloud System Admin](/admin/overview) (such as a [squad leader](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/culture/practice-building-effective-squads/)) installs and sets up a new <Globals name=\"env\" /> after the [initial inception workshop](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception), providing a place for the developers to start developing the [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception/practice_minimum_viable_product). The objective is to reduce the time required for a team to configure and prepare their development environment. The key benefit is to make the end-to-end [CI/CD development lifecycle](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/deliver/practice_continuous_delivery/) consistent across each platform and make the out-of-the-box developer experience as simple as possible.\n\nThe installation is performed using [Terraform](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform), driven by scripts with a [modular configuration](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules) so unneeded tools can be easily disabled or new tools added. The combination of tools selected are proven in the industry to deliver real value for modern cloud-native development.\n\n[Red Hat Open Innovation Labs CI/CD components](https://github.com/rht-labs/labs-ci-cd) embodies a very similar approach to how they deliver success with OpenShift.\n\n### Environment components\n\nAfter installation, the <Globals name=\"env\" /> consists of the following components and developer tools:\n- A development cluster\n- A set of backend services\n- A set of continuous delivery tools\n\nThis diagram illustrates the <Globals name=\"env\" />:\n\n![Provisioned environment](../images/catalyst-provisioned-environment.png)\n\nThe diagram shows the components in the environment: the cluster, the deployment target environments, the cloud services, and the tools.\n\n#### Development cluster\n\nThe heart of the <Globals key=\"env\" /> is a cluster:\n\n- An [<Globals key=\"iks\" />](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service)\nor [<Globals key=\"roks\" />](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift) 3-node cluster\n- Cluster namespace that encapsulates the tooling installed in the cluster: *tools*\n- Cluster namespaces for deployment target environments: *dev*, *test*, and *staging*\n\n#### Backend services\n\nThe following <Globals key=\"ic\" /> services are created and bound to the cluster:\n\n| Capability                | Service        |Description |\n| -----------------------   |:-------------- |------------|\n| Log Management            | [Log Analysis with LogDNA](/guides/log-management)  | Manage and analyze app logs  |\n| Monitoring                | [Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig](/guides/monitoring)  | Monitor app and platform resources |\n| User Authentication       | [App ID](/programming/security/)                    | Verify identities of clients accessing app end points |\n| Relational Data Storage   | [Databases For PostgreSQL](/programming/databases) (used by SonarQube) | Stores relational data structured as schemas for SQL querying |\n| Schemaless Data Storage   | [Cloudant](/programming/databases)                  | NoSQL database for JSON documents |\n| Binary Data Storage       | [Cloud Object Storage](/programming/databases)      | Storage service commonly used for binary content |\n\n#### Continuous delivery tools\n\nThe following best-of-breed open source software tools are installed in the cluster's *tools* namespace:\n\n| Capability                  | Tool           | Bitnami |Description |\n| --------------------------- |:-------------- | ------- |------------|\n| Continuous Integration      | [Jenkins CI](/guides/continuous-integration/)            |  Yes    | Jenkins is a common tool for Continuous Integration   |\n| Continuous Integration      | [Tekton CI](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton)       |         | Tekton is an emerging tool for Continuous Integration with Kubernetes and OpenShift  |\n| API Contract Testing        | [Pact](/guides/contract-testing/)                        |         | Pact enables API contract testing |\n| Code Analysis               | [SonarQube](/guides/code-analysis)                       |  Yes    | SonarQube can scan code and display the results in a dashboard |\n| Container Image Registry    | [IBM Cloud Container Registry](/guides/image-registry)   |         | Stores container images to be deployed |\n| Artifact Management         | [Artifactory](/guides/artifact-management/)              |  Yes    | Artifactory is an artifact storage and Helm chart repository  |\n| Continuous Delivery         | [ArgoCD](/guides/continuous-delivery/)                   |         | ArgoCD support Continuous Delivery with GitOps |\n| Web IDE                     | [Eclipse CHE](https://www.eclipse.org/che/)              |         | IDE for editing and managing code in a web browser |\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGet to know the <Globals string=\"shortName\" />:\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n      <AnchorLink to=\"../getting-started/overview\">Getting Started</AnchorLink>\n      <AnchorLink to=\"../getting-started/deploy-app\">Deploy Your First App</AnchorLink>\n      <AnchorLink to=\"../guides/overview\">Tools Guides</AnchorLink>\n      <AnchorLink to=\"../codepatterns/overview\"><Globals name=\"templates\" /></AnchorLink>\n      <AnchorLink to=\"../admin/overview\">Installation</AnchorLink>      \n      <AnchorLink to=\"../arch/environment\">Architectures</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"f1ebd05906a0b7807efa871253aa9eb8","counter":488,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Overview"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Overview\n---\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals'\n\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nGet familiar with using the <Globals name=\"longName\"/>\n\n</PageDescription> \n\n## Developer Environment\n\n<Globals name=\"longName\" /> provides an environment for developing cloud-native applications for deployment within Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift.
