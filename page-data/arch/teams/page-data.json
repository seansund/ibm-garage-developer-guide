There are two approaches.\n\n**Environment per team**: As described in [Environment Architecture](/arch/environment), each development team gets its own <Globals name=\"env\" />.

This approach has several consequences:\n- Resources are shared, including their cost and management duties\n- Shared resources tend to be more highly utilized, although resource contention will occur between the teams\n- Teams can more easily coordinate on applications and microservices that must work together in production\n- Teams must share a single set of CI/CD tools and pipeline configurations that can be managed by a single adminstration team\n- Teams share a single *test* namespace and *staging* namespace, and must coordinate accordingly\n\nTeams that do no wish to use the same CI/CD tools or otherwise want to avoid having to coordinate with each other should use separate development environments. Teams that want to economize, share a set of CI/CD tools, and need to coordinate on application development may find a shared environment easier to use.\n\nTo create a shared environment, first install a single environment. Then create a *dev* namespace for each team, such as *dev-team1*, *dev-team2*, etc. (The original *dev* namespace can be renamed for the first team, *dev-team1*.) The multiple developer namespaces all share a single *tools* namespace and the CI/CD tools installed in it.
