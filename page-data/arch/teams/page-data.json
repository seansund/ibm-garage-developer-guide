There are two approaches.\n\n**Environment per team**: As described in [Environment Architecture](/arch/environment), each development team gets its own <Globals name=\"env\" />. This approach has several consequences:\n- Each team's environment is built of independent resources that can be managed and even billed separately\n- Each team can customize the size of its environment, its backend services, and its CI/CD tools\n- For teams in different geographies, each team's environment can be located in the IBM Cloud region closest to the team's geography\n- If the client paying for the application's development wants the development environment located in the client's geography, the environment can be installed in the region in that geography\n- Several small development teams will each require its own environment, which can lead to higher expense for envrionments with low utilization\n\n**Shared environment**: An alternative approach is for multiple development teams to share a single <Globals name=\"env\" />. This approach has several consequences:\n- Resources are shared, including their cost and management duties\n- Shared resources tend to be more highly utilized, although resource contention will occur between the teams\n- Teams can more easily coordinate on applications and microservices that must work together in production\n- Teams must share a single set of CI/CD tools and pipeline configurations that can be managed by a single adminstration team\n- Teams share a single *test* namespace and *staging* namespace, and must coordinate accordingly\n\nTeams that do no wish to use the same CI/CD tools or otherwise want to avoid having to coordinate with each other should use separate development environments. Teams that want to economize, share a set of CI/CD tools, and need to coordinate on application development may find a shared environment easier to use.\n\nTo create a shared environment, first install a single environment. Then create a *dev* namespace for each team, such as *dev-team1*, *dev-team2*, etc. (The original *dev* namespace can be renamed for the first team, *dev-team1*.) The multiple developer namespaces all share a single *tools* namespace and the CI/CD tools installed in it.
