To learn more about these topics, after installing the environment, consult the educational materials \nlisted in the Learning section [Cloud-Native Learning](/learning).\n\n## User accounts\n\nYou'll need the following accounts to complete the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> Getting Started steps.\n\n### Github account\n\nYou will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com) (public, not enterprise) to use the Starter Kit templates. Create \none if you do not have one already. If you have not logged in for a while, make sure your login is working.\n\n### IBM Cloud account\n\nCreate an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com), if you don't have one already, and make sure you can log in. \n  \nIf you're going to [create a cluster](/admin/installation-ibm-cloud), you need to be \na [member of a paid account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-iamuserinv) and have permissions to create a cluster.\nOtherwise, you can be added to another account and be granted access to an existing cluster.\n\n## Account tokens\n\n### Configure a Github personal access token\n\nFor your CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/tools/jenkins), [Tekton](/tools/tekton/), etc) to \nconnect to and use your GitHub repo, it will need a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) \nwith `public_repo` and `write:repo_hook` scopes. The Personal Access Token only needs to be generated once because it is \nassociated with the GitHub organization and can be used to access any of the organization's repos.\n\n- Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token; name it something like \"CI pipeline\"\n- Select `public_repo` scope to enable git clone\n- Select `write:repo_hook` scope so the pipeline can create a web hook\n  \n    ![Pipeline OAuth scopes](./pipeline-scopes.png)\n  \n- The GitHub UI will never again let you see this token, so be sure to save the token in your password manager or somewhere safe that you can access later on\n\n### Create an IBM Cloud API Key\n\nAPI Keys are tokens scoped to a particular IBM Cloud account that can be used to access cloud services, particularly through\nthe IBM Cloud CLI. Generate an API Key for whichever account contains the cluster you will be using for the Getting Started\nactivities.\n\nFollow these steps to [create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key) and\ndownload the key to a file. Be sure to include a descriptive name of the API Key so you know where it is used.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"bf31dfb5a7958f0e417545dc5085adc4","counter":1024,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prerequisites"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Prerequisites\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nPrepare your accounts for the <Globals name=\"shortName\" />\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nTo complete the Getting Started activities, you will need to have a couple of accounts set up and some tokens created. \nBoth developers and administrators will need to perform these steps.\n\nThis guide assumes that you have some basic knowledge of Kubernetes, Docker, and modern software delivery techniques \nincluding CI/CD.
