It is designed to help you navigate to the installed tools and give you a simple way to perform common developer tasks, such as:\n- **Dashboard**: Navigate to the tools installed in the cluster\n- **Activation**: Links to education to help you learn cloud-native development and deployment using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud\n- **<Globals name=\"templates\" />**: Links to templates that will help accelerate your project\n\nWith the release of **<Globals name=\"ocp\" />**, it is now even easier for developers to integrate the SDLC tools into the OpenShift console. This console is mainly focused on providing a simple navigation experience when the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> is installed into <Globals name=\"iks\" />.\n\n![Developer Dashboard](/images/developer-dashboard.png)\n\nHere are some recent improvements:\n- More tools can be added to the dashboard using a simple `igc tool-config` command\n- Prefix (shown above as \"IBM\") and Title (shown above as \"Cloud Native Toolkit\") can be customized to you own names\n- The IBM Cloud link can be overidden to support links to other cloud vendors when OpenShift is running on Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, or VMWare\n- The tools view is split into more columns to enable more reuse of the screen\n- The Cluster information is now available when you click on \"Developer Dashboard\" title\n- The <Globals name=\"igccli\" /> now installs an alias into the `oc` and `kubectl` so it is now possible to open the dashboard quickly using `oc dashboard` and `kubectl dashboard`\n \n### Tools configured with OpenShift console\n\nWhen the administrator configures your <Globals name=\"env\" />, they can customize a set of short cut links to common tools you often use as a developer. \n  \n![OpenShift Links](/images/openshift-console-tools.png)\n\nYou can see how these tools are configured by reading the [Tools configuration](/admin/config-dashboard)\n \n \n### Opening the Dashboard\n\nYou can open the Dashboard from a terminal.\n\n- Open a terminal\n- Make sure your terminal is logged into your Development cluster\n    - In the IBM Cloud console, navigate to your cluster's overview\n    - Switch to the **Access** tab\n    - Follow the instructions to log in from the command line\n- Use the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli#dashboard) to open the Dashboard in your environment\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift\">\n\n```bash\noc dashboard\n```\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n```bash\nkubectl dashboard\n```\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"IGC\">\n\n```bash\nigc dashboard\n```\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n- This will open the Dashboard\n\n### Access the tools URLs\n\nYou can open the dashboard for any tool via its URL.\n\n- To list the ingress endpoints for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](/getting-started/cli) to run the following command:\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift\">\n\n```bash\noc endpoints -n tools\n```\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"Kubernetes\">\n\n```bash\nkubectl endpoints\n```\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"IGC\">\n\n```bash\nigc endpoints\n```\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n\n- This will return the ingress URLs for all of the tools installed in the Developer Tools cluster.\n    ```bash\n    ?
