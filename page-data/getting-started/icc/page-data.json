It is the equivalent of running this for Kubernetes:\n```shell\nibmcloud login <a whole bunch of paratemers>\nibmcloud ks cluster <some more parameters>\n```\n\nor this for OpenShift:\n\n```shell\nibmcloud login <a whole bunch of paratemers>\noc login <some more parameters>\n```\n\nIf you have multiple clusters, especially in multiple accounts, ICC makes it easy to switch your command line between clusters. All ICC requires is your API key for each account.\n\n## Install ICC\n\nTo install ICC, perform [Developer Tools Setup](/getting-started/dev-env-setup) to install all of the CLIs including ICC.\n\n### Install yq\n\nICC (currently) requires `yq`, and it has to be v3 (v4 doesn't have the commands ICC needs). Check to see if `yq` is currently installed and if it's version 3:\n```shell\n$ which yq\n/usr/local/bin/yq\n$ yq -V\nyq version 3.3.2\n```\n\nIf you don't have `yq` installed, follow either of these instructions:\n- Installing yq in [Installing Command-Line Tools > For macOS](https://docs.pivotal.io/scdf-k8s/1-1/installing-command-line-tools.html#macos)\n  - Download the [latest v3 build](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/tag/3.4.1)\n- Install [yq v3 using Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yq@3)\n   ```shell\n   $ brew install yq@3\n   ```\n   And follow the instructions to add the install directory to your path.\n\n### ICC help\n\nOnce ICC (and yq) is installed, you can view help for how to use it:\n```shell\nicc --help\nUsage: icc [nickname] [--account {ACCOUNT_FILTER}] [--resourceGroup {RG_FILTER}] [--generate [{ACCOUNT_FILTER}]] [--nickname [{cluster name}]]\n\n  Logs into an IBM Cloud cluster\n\nModes:\n  cluster login   - icc {nickname}\n  print config    - icc [--account {account name}] [--resourceGroup {resourceGroupName}]\n  generate config - icc --generate [{account name}]\n  update nickname - icc --nickname [{cluster name}]\n\nArgs:\n  nickname - the cluster nickname\n  --account, -a - filter to print the config for the provided account\n  --resourceGroup, -g - filter to print the config for the provided resource group\n  --generate - flag to generate the config from the account, optionally restricted to {account name}. The --generate process appends to the existing configuration\n  --nickname - update the nickname for a cluster, optionally passing the cluster name after the flag\n  --help, -h - display help\n```\n\n## Configure ICC\n\nOnce ICC is installed, before you can use it, you need to set it up:\n1. Get your API key for your IBM Cloud account. If you don't have one, then [create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key). Remember, [your API key is uniquely for you](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manapikey#ibm-cloud-api-keys), so keep it secret.\n\n2. Run `icc --add-account` to add you API key to ICC\n   ```shell\n   icc --add-account\n   Please provide the nickname for the IBM Cloud account: my-account\n   Provide the IBM Cloud API Key for the my-account account: <hidden>\n   Account information added for my-account\n\n   Next steps:\n   - Run '/Users/bwoolf/bin/icc --generate' to generate the cluster config from the account\n   ```\n   This creates the files `~/ibmcloud-account.yaml` and `~/ibmcloud.yaml`. The first file contains your API keys, so keep it secret.\n\n3. Get the cluster metadata for the account by running `icc --generate`\n   ```shell\n   icc --generate\n   Generate config for accounts: my-account\n   Logging in to account: my-account\n   Processing provider: classic\n   Processing provider: vpc-gen2\n   Processing provider: satellite\n   Config file generated/updated: /Users/bwoolf/ibmcloud.yaml\n\n   Next steps:\n   - Run '/Users/bwoolf/bin/icc' to list the clusters\n   - Run '/Users/bwoolf/bin/icc {nickname}' to log into a cluster\n   - Run '/Users/bwoolf/bin/icc --nickname' to update the nickname for a cluster\n   ```\n   \n<InlineNotification>\n\nIf you have multiple accounts, run `icc --add-account` multiple times to add the different API Keys. Also, `icc --generate` can be run multiple times to refresh the list of available clusters. Any nicknames that have been added\nwill be preserved.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n4. List the available clusters with `icc`\n   ```shell\n   icc\n   my-cluster - my-account/my-resource-group/my-cluster\n   ```\n5. Optionally, give a short nickname for your cluster by running `icc --nickname`\n   ```shell\n   icc --nickname my-cluster\n   Provide the new nickname for my-cluster: my-nickname\n   Nickname for my-cluster updated to my-nickname in /Users/bwoolf/ibmcloud.yaml\n   \n   icc\n   my-nickname - my-account/my-resource-group/my-cluster\n   ```\n\n## Use ICC\n\nYou can now log in to a cluster by running `icc [cluster name|cluster nickname]`\n```shell\nicc my-cluster\nLogging into ibmcloud: us-south/my-resource-group\nLogging into OpenShift cluster my-cluster with server url https://x123-z.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com:31047\n```\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"b41105593c0e941bfef82015055932b3","counter":1022,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"IBM Cloud cluster fast-switching (icc) tool"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: IBM Cloud cluster fast-switching (icc) tool\n---\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nEasily log in to an IBM Cloud account and cluster\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nThe ICC command-line tool makes it easy to log into an IBM Cloud account and a cluster in that account.
