Prerequisites\n    - The instructor should [Setup Workshop Environment](/workshop/setup)\n    - The student should [Setup CLI and Terminal Shell](/workshop/terminal)\n    - An user with cluster-admin (ie kubeadmin) needs to deploy a DB2 instance to be shared by all the users\n    ```bash\n    oc new-project db2\n    oc create -n db2 serviceaccount mysvcacct\n    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:db2:mysvcacct\n    oc apply -n db2 -f \"http://$(oc get route -n tools gogs --template='{{.spec.host}}')/toolkit/appmod-liberty-toolkit/raw/master/db2/db2-dc.yaml\"\n    oc apply -n db2 -f \"http://$(oc get route -n tools gogs --template='{{.spec.host}}')/toolkit/appmod-liberty-toolkit/raw/master/db2/db2-service.yaml\"\n    ```\n\n1. (Optional) Analyze the application using the following guide [Modernizing runtimes with Liberty](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/applications/liberty/liberty-analyze)\n    - Download [Transformation Advisor](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/learn/ibm-transformation-advisor/)\n    - The results of a Data Collector is already provided provided download <a href=\"/AppSrv01.zip\" target=\"_blank\">AppSrv01.zip</a>\n    - Upload the data collection into Transformation Advisor\n    - Review the CustomerOrderServicesApp.ear analysis\n    - The migration path files have been deployed to git for this lab.\n\n1. Instructor will provide the following info:\n    - OpenShift Console URL (OCP_CONSOLE_URL)\n    - The username and password for OpenShift and Git Server (default values are user01, user02, etc.. for users and `password` for password).\n\n1. Set `TOOLKIT_USERNAME` environment variable.\n   If you are participation in a workshop replace `userdemo` with your assigned username (ex. `user01`).\n    ```bash\n    TOOLKIT_USERNAME=userdemo\n    ```\n1. Login to OpenShift using `oc`\n    - If using IBM Cloud cluster then login with your IBM account email and IAM API Key or Token by using the **Copy Login Command**\n        ![Login](../images/login.jpg)\n    - If using a cluster that was configured with the workshop scripts outside IBM Cloud then use respective assigned username (ex. `user01`), and the password is `password`\n    ```bash\n    oc login $OCP_URL -u $TOOLKIT_USERNAME -p password\n    ```\n\n1. Set `TOOLKIT_PROJECT` environment variable\n   If you are participation in a workshop replace `projectdemo` based on your assigned username (ex. `project01`).\n    ```bash\n    TOOLKIT_PROJECT=projectdemo\n    ```\n\n1. Create a project/namespace using your project prefix, and `-dev` and suffix\n    ```bash\n    oc sync $TOOLKIT_PROJECT-dev\n    ```\n\n1. Fork Inventory Sample Application Java\n    - Open Developer Dashboard from the OpenShift Console\n    - Select Starter Kits\n    - Select **Liberty AppMod** (Java)\n    - Click Fork\n    - Login into GIT Sever using the provided username and password (ie `userdemo` and `password`)\n    - Click **Fork Repository**\n\n1. Setup environment variable `GIT_URL` for the git url using the value from previous step or as following\n    ```bash\n    GIT_REPO=appmod-liberty-toolkit\n    GIT_URL=http://${TOOLKIT_USERNAME}:password@$(oc get route -n tools gogs --template='{{.spec.host}}')/${TOOLKIT_USERNAME}/${GIT_REPO}\n    echo GIT_URL=${GIT_URL}\n    ```\n\n1. Create a pipeline for the application\n    ```bash\n    oc pipeline --tekton \\\n    ${GIT_URL}#master \\\n    --pipeline ibm-appmod-liberty \\\n    -p scan-image=false \\\n    -p health-endpoint=/ \\\n    -p java-bin-path=CustomerOrderServicesApp/target\n    ```\n    - Notice above that the Toolkit `pipeline` CLI plugin accepts pipeline names and parameters\n    - The endpoint to check that the external access is possible is `/`\n    - The Java bin path is not located based on the root of the git repository and instead in `CustomerOrderServicesApp/target`\n    - Every application would have custom values you can pass them to the pipeline as parameters.\n\n1. Verity that the Pipeline started using the URL printed by the command\n\n1. This is a good moment to take a break as the pipelines will take a few minutes.\n\n1. Verify that Pipeline Run completed successfully\n\n1. Review the Pipeline Tasks/Stages\n    - Test\n    - Open SonarQube from Console Link\n    - Open Registry from Console Link\n    - Open Artifactory from Console Link\n\n1. Review the Application in GitOps git reposistory. The pipeline step `gitops` is pushing the application manifest into the GitOps git repository\n    - Open **Git Ops** from Console link\n    - Navigate to `project01/qa/project01/appmod-liberty-toolkit`\n    - Review the Helm Chart for the Application\n\n1. Register the Application in ArgoCD to deploy using GitOps\n    - Select ArgoCD from the Console Link and login using OpenShift login\n    - Click **NEW APP**\n    - Application Name: ${TOOLKIT_PROJECT}-qa-websphere-liberty (ie project01-qa-websphere-liberty)\n    - ArgoCD Project: `default`\n    - Sync Policy: `Automatic` (Check prune resources and self heal)\n    - Repository URL: `http://gogs.tools:3000/toolkit/gitops.git`\n    - Revision: `HEAD`\n    - Path: `qa/${TOOLKIT_PROJECT}/appmod-liberty-toolkit` (ie project01/qa/project01/appmod-liberty-toolkit)\n    - Cluster: `in-cluster`\n    - Namespace: `${TOOLKIT_PROJECT}-qa` (ie. project01-qa)\n    - Click **CREATE**\n\n1. Review the Applications in ArgoCD\n    - Filter by Namespace `${TOOLKIT_PROJECT}-qa` (ie project01-qa)\n    - Review Application: `${TOOLKIT_PROJECT}-websphere-liberty` (ie project01-websphere-liberty)\n\n1. Review the Application in OpenShift\n    - Switch to Developer perspective\n    - Select **Topology** from the menu\n    - Switch to project `${TOOLKIT_PROJECT}-qa` (ie project01-qa)\n    - Click on the route url from the `appmod-liberty-toolkit` deployment, or the link on the circle.\n    - Add `/CustomerOrderServicesWeb` to the end of the URL in the browser to access the application\n    - Log in to the application with username: `rbarcia` and password: `bl0wfish`\n\n1. Now the Websphere application is ready, the development teams can make changes to git repository for the application, while the gitops git repository is owned by the operations team.\n\n1.
