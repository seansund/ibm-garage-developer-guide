Provision the cluster\n\nProvisioning the OpenShift cluster is the minimum requirement to prepare for the Toolkit install. The cluster could be\nOpenShift CRC running on a laptop, a cloud-managed OpenShift cluster on AWS or Azure, or an on-premise install of\nOpenShift. We'll leave the steps to provision to you since the details will vary considerably depending upon the \napproach. However, whichever platform you use we highly recommend utilizing or developing automation scripts to \nperform the provisioning, so that it can be done repeatably.\n\nHere are some resources that might help get started:\n\n<CardGroup>\n  <MiniCard title=\"OpenShift CRC setup\" href=\"./openshift-crc-setup\" />\n  <MiniCard title=\"OpenShift on AWS\" href=\"https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-aws\" />\n  <MiniCard title=\"OpenShift on GCP\" href=\"https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-gcp\" />\n  <MiniCard title=\"OpenShift on Azure\" href=\"https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-azure\" />\n  <MiniCard title=\"OpenShift on VMWare\" href=\"https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-vmware\" />\n</CardGroup>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nThe <Globals name=\"longName\" /> is not responsible for maintaining the Terraform scripts provided in the links above\nand does not give any guarantee as to their current condition.

Configure access to the cluster\n\nIn order to interact with the cluster, user credentials need to be established having Cluster Admin rights. The initial\n`kubeadmin` user (or whatever name is used after it is changed) can be used or a new user can be added for use by\nthe provisioning scripts.\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that the cluster has been provisioned and the access control has been configured, you are ready to move to the next\nstep and perform the installation with the Toolkit. Before moving on, be sure to record the following information:\n\n- OpenShift login user (user id with Cluster Admin permission)\n- OpenShift login password\n- OpenShift server url\n\nFor installation, use the [Iteration Zero](../install-toolkit/iteration-zero) scripts.
