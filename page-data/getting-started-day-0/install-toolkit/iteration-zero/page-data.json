Download the Iteration Zero scripts\n\n1. Clone the [ibm-garage-iteration-zero](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero) Git repository to your local filesystem\n    ```shell script\n    git clone git@github.com:ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git\n    ```\n\n### B. Configure the credentials\n\n1. In a terminal, change to the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` cloned directory\n    ```shell script\n    cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero\n    ```\n2. Copy the `credentials.template` file to a file named `credentials.properties`\n    ```shell script\n    cp credentials.template credentials.properties\n    ```\n   \n   **Note:** `credentials.properties` is already listed in `.gitignore` to prevent the\n   private credentials from being committed to the git repository\n3. Update the value for the `ibmcloud.api.key` property in `credentials.properties` with your <Globals name=\"ic\" /> API key\n\n    **Note:** The API key should have been set up during [plan installation](/getting-started-0/plan-installation/ibm-cloud).\n\n### C. Configure the Environment Variables \n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"IBM Cloud\">\n\n#### A. Set Environment Variables\n\nThe settings for creating the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> on <Globals name=\"ic\" /> are set in the `environment-ibmcloud.tfvars`\nfile in the `./terraform/settings` directory of the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` repository.\n\nThere are a number of values that can be applied in the file, some required and some optional. Consult with\nthe following table to determine which values should be used:\n\n| **Variable**          | **Required?** | **Description**                                                                     | **eg. Value**                 |\n|-----------------------|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| `cluster_type`        | yes | The type of cluster into which the toolkit will be installed                                  | `kubernetes`, `ocp3`, `ocp4` or `ocp44` |\n| `cluster_exists`      | yes | Flag indicating if the cluster already exists. (`false` means the cluster should be provisioned) | `true` or `false`          |\n| `resource_group_name` | yes | Existing resource group in the account where the cluster has been created                     | `dev-team-one`                |\n| `vpc_cluster`         | yes | Flag indicating that the cluster has been built on VPC infrastructure. Defaults to `true`     | `true` or `false`             |\n| `name_prefix`         | no  | The prefix that should be applied for any resources that are provisioned. Defaults to `{resource_group_name}` | `dev-one`     |\n| `region`              | no  | The region where the cluster has been/will be provisioned                                     | `us-east`, `eu-gb`, etc       |\n| `vpc_zone_names`      | no  | A comma-separated list of the VPC zones that should be used for worker nodes. This value is required if `cluster_exists` is set to `false` and `vpc_cluster` is set to `true` | `us-south-1` or `us-east-1,us-east-2` |\n| `cluster_name`        | no  | The name of the cluster (If `cluster_exists` is set to `true` then this name should match an existing cluster). Defaults to `{prefix_name}-cluster` or `{resource_group_name}-cluster` | `dev-team-one-iks-117-vpc` |\n| `registry_namespace`  | no  | The namespace that should be used in the IBM Container Registry. Defaults to `{resource_group_name}` | `dev-team-one-registry-2020` |\n| `provision_logdna`    | no  | Flag indicating that a new instance of LogDNA should be provisioned. Defaults to `false`      | `true` or `false`          |\n| `logdna_name`         | no  | The name of the LogDNA instance (If `provision_logdna` is set to `false` this value is used by the scripts to bind the existing LogDNA instance to the cluster) | `cntk-showcase-logdna` |\n| `provision_sysdig`    | no  | Flag indicating that a new instance of Sysdig should be provisioned. Defaults to `false`      | `true` or `false`          |\n| `sysdig_name`         | no  | The name of the Sysdig instance (If `provision_sysdig` is set to `false` this value is used by the scripts to bind the existing Sysdig instance to the cluster) | `cntk-showcase-sysdig` |\n\n<br />\n\nUpdate `environment-ibmcloud.tfvars` with the appropriate values for your installation. Since this is for a new cluster\non classic infrastructure, the following values should be used:\n\n- **cluster_exists:** `false`\n- **vpc_cluster:** `false`\n\n#### B. Configure the VLAN settings\n\nThe `vlan.tfvars` file in `terraform/settings` contains properties that define the classic infrastructure configuration in order to provision a \nnew cluster. Typical values look like this:\n\n```shell script\nvlan_datacenter=\"dal10\"\npublic_vlan_id=\"2366011\"\nprivate_vlan_id=\"2366012\"\n```\n\nYou must set all of these specifically for your cluster. Use the values provided by the account manager.\n\n- `vlan_datacenter` -- The zone in the region in which the cluster worker nodes will be provisioned\n- `public_vlan_id` -- The public VLAN that the cluster will use\n- `private_vlan_id` -- The private VLAN that the cluster will use\n\n#### Optional: Generate the VLAN properties\n\nThe [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) can be used to generate these settings, to make the configuration as simple as possible.\n\nIf your account has numerous VLANs and you want your cluster to use specific ones, then skip this step and provide the \nvalues by hand. This tool is for users who don't know what these required settings should be and want a simple way to \ngather reasonable defaults for their particular account.\n\n1. Log in using the <Globals name=\"igcli\" />\n2. Target the region where the cluster will be provisioned with the <Globals name=\"igcli\" />\n    ```shell script\n    ibmcloud target -r {region}\n    ```\n2. Run the VLAN command\n    ```shell script\n    igc vlan\n    ```\n3. Copy the output values from the CLI Command into your `vlan.tfvars` files\n\n#### C. (Optional) Customize the installed components\n\nThe `terraform/stages` directory contains the default set of stages that define the\nmodules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change\nthe makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the \n`terraform/stages` directory. \n\n**Note:** The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all\ndepend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those\ndependencies as you start making changes. Dependencies are reflected in the `module.{stage name}` references \nin the stage variable list.\n\nThe `terraform/stages/catalog` directory contains some optional\nstages that are prep-configured and can be dropped into the `terraform/stages` directory. Other\nmodules are available from the [Garage Terraform Modules](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules)\ncatalog and can be added as stages to the directory as well. Since this is Terraform,\nany other Terraform scripts and modules can be added to the `terraform/stages` directory\nas desired.\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"Multi-Cloud\">\n\n#### A. Set Environment Variables\n\nThe configuration values for provisioning the environment on an existing OpenShift cluster are set in the `environment-ocp.tfvars`\nfile in the `./terraform/settings` directory of the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` repository. There are only two values available:\n\n| **Variable**          | **Required?** | **Description**                                                                     | **eg. Value**                 |\n|-----------------------|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| `server_url`          | yes | The url of the OpenShift cluster's API server                                                 | `https://api.mycluster.com`   |\n| `cluster_name`        | no  | The name of the cluster used simply for identification purposes. Defaults to `ocp-cluster`    | `dev-team-one-ocp44`          |\n\n#### B. (Optional) Customize the installed components\n\nThe `terraform/stages-ocp4` directory contains the default set of stages that define the\nmodules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change\nthe makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the \n`terraform/stages-ocp4` directory. \n\n**Note:** The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all\ndepend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those\ndependencies as you start making changes.

Open a terminal to the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` directory\n2. Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cli-tools \"Cloud Garage Tools Docker image\") from which the Terraform scripts will be run\n    ```shell script\n    ./launch.sh\n    ```\n\n    This will download the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image that contains all the necessary tools to execute Terraform scripts\n    and exec shell into the running container. When the container starts it \n    mounts the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/` and loads the values from the\n    `credentials.properties` file as environment variables.\n\n3. Apply the Terraform by running the provided `runTerraform.sh` script\n\n    ```shell script\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n    \n    This script collects the values provided in the `environment-ibmcloud.tfvars` and the\n    stages defined in the `terraform/stages` to build the Terraform workspace. Along the way it\n    will prompt for a couple pieces of information.\n    \n    1. Type of installation: `ibmcloud` or `ocp`\n    \n        There are two major paths to installing with the Toolkit. In this case, we are installing\n        into an <Globals name=\"ic\" />-managed environment so we will select `ibmcloud`.\n        \n        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--ibmcloud` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n    \n    2. Handling of an old workspace (if applicable): `keep` or `delete`\n    \n        If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still\n        exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if\n        you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete\n        the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit. \n        \n        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--delete` or `--keep` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    3. Verify the installation configuration\n    \n        The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes), \n        the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.\n    \n        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--auto-approve` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer) \n    and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"521a3035876e2d683b4324fa58358b9e","counter":943,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Install the Toolkit using Iteration Zero.","tabs":["Quick Install","Private Catalog","Iteration Zero"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Install the Toolkit using Iteration Zero.\ntabs: ['Quick Install', 'Private Catalog', 'Iteration Zero']\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nSteps to install the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> for running Openshift or Kubernetes clusters.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n\n### A.
