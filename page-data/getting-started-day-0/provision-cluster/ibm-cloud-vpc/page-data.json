Particularly, be sure to set the \nfollowing values in order to provision a VPC cluster:\n\n- `cluster_exists` to `false`\n- `vpc_cluster` to `true`\n\n### D. (Optional) Customize the installed components\n\n<br />\n\nThe `terraform/stages` directory contains the default set of stages that define the\nmodules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change\nthe makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the\n`terraform/stages` directory.\n\n**Note:** The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all\ndepend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those\ndependencies as you start making changes. Dependencies are reflected in the `module.{stage name}` references\nin the stage variable list.\n\nThe `terraform/stages/catalog` directory contains some optional\nstages that are prep-configured and can be dropped into the `terraform/stages` directory. Other\nmodules are available from the [Garage Terraform Modules](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/garage-terraform-modules)\ncatalog and can be added as stages to the directory as well. Since this is Terraform,\nany other Terraform scripts and modules can be added to the `terraform/stages` directory\nas desired.\n\n### E. Run the installation\n\n<br />\n\n1. Open a terminal to the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` directory\n2. Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-cli-tools \"Cloud Garage Tools Docker image\") from which the Terraform scripts will be run\n   \n    ```shell\n    ./launch.sh\n    ```\n\n    This will download the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image that contains all the necessary tools to execute Terraform scripts\n    and exec shell into the running container. When the container starts it\n    mounts the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/` and loads the values from the\n    `credentials.properties` file as environment variables.\n\n3. Apply the Terraform by running the provided `runTerraform.sh` script\n\n    ```shell\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n\n    This script collects the values provided in the `environment-ibmcloud.tfvars` and the\n    stages defined in the `terraform/stages` to build the Terraform workspace. Along the way it\n    will prompt for a couple pieces of information.\n\n    1. Type of installation: `cluster`\n    \n        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--cluster` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    2. Handling of an old workspace (if applicable): `keep` or `delete`\n\n        If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still\n        exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if\n        you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete\n        the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit.\n\n        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--delete` or `--keep` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    3. Verify the installation configuration\n\n        The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes),\n        the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.\n\n        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--auto-approve` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer)\n    and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes.\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you find that the Terraform provisioning has failed, for Private Catalog delete the workspace and for Iteration Zero  try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again.\nThe state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.\n\nIf you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, try the following with Iteration zero:\n\n1. Manually delete the service instances in your resource group\n3. Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script with the `--delete` argument to clean up the state\n   \n    ```shell\n    ./runTerraform.sh --delete\n    ```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d803f5e93368f2115143d2dd790334a9","counter":1032,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Provision an IBM Cloud cluster","tabs":["IBM Cloud VPC","IBM Cloud Classic","Multi-Cloud"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Provision an IBM Cloud cluster \ntabs: ['IBM Cloud VPC', 'IBM Cloud Classic', 'Multi-Cloud']\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nSteps to provision a new <Globals name=\"ic\" />-managed cluster\nrunning on VPC infrastructure using the <Globals name=\"shortName\" />.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nSee the following for instructions on how to\nprovision [new <Globals name=\"ic\" />-managed clusters running on classic\ninfrastructure](./ibm-cloud-classic)\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Private Catalog\" open=\"true\">\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nThese steps assume the private catalog has been created and populated with the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> tiles during \nthe [prepare the account](/getting-started-day-0/prepare-account#3.-create-the-private-catalog) steps.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n<br />\n\n1.

Particularly, be sure to set the \nfollowing values in order to provision a VPC cluster:\n\n- `cluster_exists` to `false`\n- `vpc_cluster` to `true`\n\n### D. (Optional) Customize the installed components\n\n<br />\n\nThe `terraform/stages` directory contains the default set of stages that define the\nmodules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change\nthe makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the\n`terraform/stages` directory.\n\n**Note:** The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all\ndepend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those\ndependencies as you start making changes. Dependencies are reflected in the `module.{stage name}` references\nin the stage variable list.\n\nThe `terraform/stages/catalog` directory contains some optional\nstages that are prep-configured and can be dropped into the `terraform/stages` directory. Other\nmodules are available from the [Garage Terraform Modules](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/garage-terraform-modules)\ncatalog and can be added as stages to the directory as well. Since this is Terraform,\nany other Terraform scripts and modules can be added to the `terraform/stages` directory\nas desired.\n\n### E. Run the installation\n\n<br />\n\n1. Open a terminal to the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` directory\n2. Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-cli-tools \"Cloud Garage Tools Docker image\") from which the Terraform scripts will be run\n   \n    ```shell\n    ./launch.sh\n    ```\n\n    This will download the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image that contains all the necessary tools to execute Terraform scripts\n    and exec shell into the running container. When the container starts it\n    mounts the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/` and loads the values from the\n    `credentials.properties` file as environment variables.\n\n3. Apply the Terraform by running the provided `runTerraform.sh` script\n\n    ```shell\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n\n    This script collects the values provided in the `environment-ibmcloud.tfvars` and the\n    stages defined in the `terraform/stages` to build the Terraform workspace. Along the way it\n    will prompt for a couple pieces of information.\n\n    1. Type of installation: `cluster`\n    \n        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--cluster` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    2. Handling of an old workspace (if applicable): `keep` or `delete`\n\n        If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still\n        exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if\n        you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete\n        the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit.\n\n        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--delete` or `--keep` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    3. Verify the installation configuration\n\n        The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes),\n        the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.\n\n        This prompt can be skipped by providing `--auto-approve` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer)\n    and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes.\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you find that the Terraform provisioning has failed, for Private Catalog delete the workspace and for Iteration Zero  try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again.\nThe state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.\n\nIf you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, try the following with Iteration zero:\n\n1. Manually delete the service instances in your resource group\n3. Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script with the `--delete` argument to clean up the state\n   \n    ```shell\n    ./runTerraform.sh --delete\n    ```\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/ibm-garage-developer-guide/ibm-garage-developer-guide/src/pages/getting-started-day-0/provision-cluster/ibm-cloud-vpc.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1054721580","1054721580","1317950067","1317950067","1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","223705900","3273249464","530240012","530240012","768070550"]}
