For each environment, the account managers will:\n- Create a resource group\n- Create an access group named `<resource_group>-ADMIN` using the script `acp-admin`\n- Create an access group named `<resource_group>-USER` using the script `acp-user`\n\n### Environment administrators\n\nThe `environment administrators` are users in the account \nwith [permissions to create services in the environment's resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#platformroles). In\nthis case, the \"environment\" is scoped to the `resource group`. Environment administrators are granted broad access\nto create, manage, and destroy services and resources within a given `resource group`.\n\n### Environment users\n\nThe `environment users` are users in the account with [permissions to use existing services in the environment's resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#service_access_roles) \n(e.g. developers, data scientists, etc.). They are consumers of the services and resources that have been provisioned in\norder to build and deploy business applications.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe [Environment Architecture](/arch/environment) page shows the structure of the environment that will be installed. Depending upon\nthe approach for development teams, each [development team](/arch/teams) can be assigned its own (small) environment or\nmultiple teams can share a single environment.
