These can contain custom Terraform definitions that can accelerate an\n  SRE teams in the execution of common and repetitive tasks. The CNCF DevOps\n   tools installation can be configured as a private catalog tile. This is\n    the recommend approach for using this asset multiple times. This asset\n     enables the easy transition of a default cluster into a cluster that\n      supports Cloud-Native CI/CD development tools.\n\n- First step is to create a Catalog, Click **Manage->Catalogs**\n- Click on **Create Catalog** , provide a name for example `Team Catalog`\n- Click **Update** to change the default resource group for the Catalog\n- Click **Create** to complete the Catalog Creation\n\n- Next step is to run the following script to register <Globals name=\"shortName\" />\n tile into the Catalog as an offering. You will need an IBM Cloud API Key\n\n- Download the current release of `create-catalog-offering.sh` from the <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero/releases\" target=\"_blank\">latest releases link</a>\n- Allow the script to execute in a command shell `chmod +x create-catalog-offering.sh`\n- Run the `create-catalog-offering.sh` scripts passing in the API Key and the name of the\n Catalog that you created\n- If you are not running this from the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-shell\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Shell</a> you will need to install `jq` into you command line environment <a href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/\" target=\"_blank\">jq downloads</a>\n    ```bash\n    chmod +x create-catalog-offering.sh\n    ./create-catalog-offering.sh {API_KEY} \"Team Catalog\"\n    ```\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Apply\">\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nTo support the running of the Terraform for the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> installation configure your variables\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nThe installation requires a set of variables to be set for to match your environment.\n\nThe installation supports Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Kubernetes clusters in both **Classic** and **VPC Gen2** networking configurations.\n\n- Once you have completed the Offering Tile configuration, navigate to the new\n Catalog. You can do this from the IBM Cloud Console select you Catalog ie. `Team Catalog`and click on the **Private** menu on the on the left you can\n  select the catalog you have created `Team Catalog`\n- Select the **Cloud Native Toolkit** tile\n- Enter values for the variables list , these can be customized depending\n on the type of cluster and if its in classic or VPC\n\n    | **Variable**          | **Description**  | **eg.
