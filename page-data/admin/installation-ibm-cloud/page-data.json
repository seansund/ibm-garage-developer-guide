Two keys will be needed:\n- The first key authorizes creating Classic Infrastructure (IaaS) resources\n- The second key authorizes creating IBM Cloud (PaaS) resources\n\nThe following steps create the required keys and put them into a file called `credentials.properties`.\n\n- The `credentials.properties` property file looks like this:\n\n    ```bash\n    classic.username=<CLASSIC_USERNAME>\n    classic.api.key=<CLASSIC_API_KEY>\n    ibmcloud.api.key=<IBMCLOUD_API_KEY>\n    ```\n\nThe installation scripts will use these keys to authenticate to IBM Cloud.\n\n### Step A. Create the credentials.properties file\n\n- Inside the `iteration-zero-ibmcloud` folder, copy `credentials.template` to a file named `credentials.properties`.\n    ```bash\n    cd iteration-zero-ibmcloud\n    cp credentials.template credentials.properties\n    ```\n\nThe `credentials.properties` file is already listed in the `.gitignore` file so that the file containing \nyour private API keys will not be pushed to the server repository.\n\n### Step B. Set the Classic infrastructure API key\n\n- Follow these instructions to [create a Classic infrastructure API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-classic_keys \"Managing classic infrastructure API keys\"):\n\n    - In the IBM Cloud console, go to the IBM Cloud API Keys page\n\n    To open the IBM Cloud API Keys page, select **Manage -> Access (IAM)**, then select the **IBM Cloud API keys** tab.\n\n    - If your account already has a classic infrastructure API key, it will appear in the list of keys as **Classic infrastructure API key**. Otherwise, the page will have a **Create a classic infrastructure API key** button on the top. To crate the key, press that button and close the dialog.\n\n    ![API Keys](/images/apikeys.png)\n\n    - Find **Classic infrastructure API key** in the list and open its details.\n\n    ![Classic Keys](/images/classickeys.png)\n\n- Edit the `credentials.properties` file to set the values for the `classic.username` and `classic.api.key` properties.\n\n### Step C. Set the IBM Cloud API key\n\n- Follow these instructions to create an IBM Cloud API key:\n\n    - [Managing user API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userapikey \"Managing user API keys\")\n\n- Edit the `credentials.properties` file to set the value for the `ibmcloud.api.key` property.\n\n</Tab>\n\n\n<Tab label=\"Configuration\">\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nConfigure the properties describing your environment\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n### Configuring Properties files\n\nThe settings for creating the <Globals name=\"env\" /> go in two properties files\nin the `./terraform/settings` directory:\n- `environment.tfvars` -- Properties for installing the environment\n- `vlan.tfvars` -- Properties for creating the cluster\n\nThe next few steps will find the necessary resources and set them in the `tfvars` files. \nAlong the way, if any of these resources don't already exist, you'll need to create them.\nThere is a tool for optionally generating the VLAN variables. \n\n### Environment variables\n\nThe `environment.tfvars` properties will be used to install the Development Tools environment.\n\n- Typical values look like this:\n\n    ```bash\n    # The type of cluster that will be created/used (kubernetes or openshift)\n    cluster_type=\"openshift\"\n    # Flag indicating if we are using an existing cluster or creating a new one\n    cluster_exists=\"true\"\n\n    # The prefix that should be applied to the cluster name and service names (if not provided\n    # explicitly). If not provided then the resource_group_name will be used as the prefix.\n    #name_prefix=\"<name prefix for cluster and services>\"\n    #name_prefix=\"garage-cloud-surge\"\n\n    # The cluster name can be provided (particularly if using an existing cluster). The value\n    # for cluster name used by the scripts will be set in the following order of presidence:\n    # - \"${cluster_name}\"\n    # - \"${name_prefix}-cluster\"\n    # - \"${resource_group_name}-cluster\"\n    #cluster_name=\"<cluster name>\"\n    cluster_name=\"garage-cloud-surge-ocp-cluster\"\n\n    resource_group_name=\"garage-cloud-surge\"\n    vlan_region=\"us-south\"\n\n    # Flag indicating if we are using an existing postgres server or creating a new one\n    postgres_server_exists=\"false\"\n    ```\n\n<p/>\n\nSome of these values are given to you by the account manager:\n- `resource_group_name` -- The resource group the cluster and environment will be created in\n- `vlan_region` -- The region the cluster and environment will be created in\n\nThe other variables have reasonable defaults that you can change if desired:\n- Set `cluster_name` to specify any valid cluster name that is not already in use or leave unset\n- Set `cluster_type` to specify whether the cluster is **kubernetes** or **openshift**\n\n- `cluster_exists` -- Set to `false` to create a new cluster\n- `cluster_type` -- Specify the new cluster's type\n    - **kubernetes** -- Kubernetes\n    - **openshift** -- OpenShift v3\n    - **ocp3** -- OpenShift v3\n    - **ocp4** -- OpenShift v4\n    - ~~**crc** -- CodeReady Containers~~\n- `cluster_name` -- The name for the new cluster\n- `registry_namespace` -- The namespace that will be created with the IBM Container Registry. If not provided\nthe value will default to the `resource_group_name`\n- `logdna_exists` -- \"true\" or \"false\" flag indicating that the logdna instance already exists and a new one \nshould not be provisioned\n- `logdna_name` -- The name of the logdna instance, particularly if one already exists. If not provided the name\nwill be generated as `{prefix-name || resource-group-name}-logdna`\n- `sysdig_exists` -- \"true\" or \"false\" flag indicating that the sysdig instance already exists and a new one \nshould not be provisioned\n- `sysdig_name` -- The name of the sysdig instance, particularly if one already exists. If not provided the name\nwill be generated as `{prefix-name || resource-group-name}-sysdig`\n\n### VLANs\n\nThe `vlan.tfvars` properties will be used to create the cluster that the Developer Tools will be installed into.\n\n- Typical values look like this:\n    ```bash\n    vlan_region=\"us-south\"\n    vlan_datacenter=\"dal10\"\n    public_vlan_id=\"2366011\"\n    private_vlan_id=\"2366012\"\n    ```\n\nYou must set all of these specifically for your cluster. Use the values provided by the account manager.\n\n- In `vlan.tfvars`, set the following properties:\n   - `vlan_region` -- The region that the cluster will be in\n   - `vlan_datacenter` -- The zone in that region that the cluster will be in\n    - `public_vlan_id` -- The public VLAN that the cluster will use\n    - `private_vlan_id` -- The private VLAN that the cluster will use\n\n#### Optional: Generate the properties\n\nThe IGC CLI can be used to generate these settings, to make the configuration as simple as possible.\n\nIf your account has numerous VLANs and you want your Developer Tools cluster to use specific ones, then skip this step. This tool is for users who don't know what these required settings should be and want a simple way to gather reasonable defaults for their particular account.\n\nThe [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) has a command to gather this information for you, in a format that is easy to cut/paste into the `vlan.tfvars` properties file.\n\n- Install the IGC CLI\n\n- Log in to IBM Cloud using its CLI\n\n- Run the VLAN command\n    ```bash\n    igc vlan\n    ```\n- Copy the output values from the CLI Command into your `vlan.tfvars` files and **Save** and continue\n\n</Tab>\n\n\n<Tab label=\"Run\">\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nRun the scripts that create the environment\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nHaving configured the `credentials.properties`, `environment.tfvars`, and `vlan.tfvars` properties files, \nwe are now ready to kick off the installation.\n\n- Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cli-tools \"Cloud Garage Tools Docker image\").\n\n    Run the following command to run the Docker container:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh\n    ```\n\n    This will install the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image and exec shell into the running container. The container will \n    mount the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/`. Once the Docker container has started and \n    the script has exec shelled into it, you will see an IBM Garage banner. This will help you identify you are running \n    inside the Docker image that has just mounted your file system.\n\n    For more information on the **Developer Tools Image** see the following guide link below.\n\n- Create the <Globals name=\"env\" />\n\n    The supplied Terraform script is ready to run using the settings in the properties files. \n    You optionally can extend or modify the scripts and tailor them for your project's specific needs.\n\n    Run this script in the container:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n\n    This script will create the <Globals name=\"env\" />.\n    \n    If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still\n    exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if\n    you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete\n    the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit.\n\n    The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes), \n    the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.\n    \n    Both of the prompts can be skipped via command-line arguments passed to the script. To bypass the workspace\n    prompt, provided either `--delete` or `--keep` to either delete or keep the workspace, respectively. To\n    bypass the verification prompt provide `--auto-approve` and the script will automatically answer `Yes` to\n    the prompt and start the terraform process.\n\n    Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer) \n    and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes.\n\n    <InlineNotification kind=\"success\">\n\n    You should now have your <Globals name=\"env\" /> fully provisioned and configured. Enjoy!\n\n    </InlineNotification>\n\n\n\n### <Globals name=\"env\" />\n\nOnce the Terraform scripts have finished, you can see the resources that the scripts created in IBM Cloud:\n- In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#dashboardview \"Managing resources in the resource list\")\n- On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group (e.g. `appdev-team`)\n- You should see these resources listed:\n    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift\n    - **Services**: 5 or so, such as PostgreSQL, LogDNA, etc.\n    - **Storage**: 1, an instance of Cloud Object Storage\n- Select the cluster and open the Kubernetes dashboard or OpenShift web console. You should see:\n    - Namespaces: `tools`, `dev`, `test`, and `staging`\n    - Deployments in the `tools` namespace: `developer-dashboard`, `jenkins`, etc.\n\nTo get started with code use the following guides:\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/getting-started-day-1/deploy-app\">Deploy First App</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/tools\">Guides</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/tools/tools-image\">Developer Tools Image</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n### Possible issues\n\nIf you find that that the Terraform provisioning has failed, try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again. \nThe state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.\n\nIf you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, you can try this:\n- Manually delete the service instances in your resource group\n- Delete the `workspace` directory (which will remove any state that has been created by Terraform)\n- Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script\n    ```bash\n    rm -rf workspace\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"8adcce8c65eedf579590e3e733dd09dd","counter":944,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Install with new cluster"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Install with new cluster\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note**: An **environment administrator** performs the steps on this page.

This tool is for users who don't know what these required settings should be and want a simple way to gather reasonable defaults for their particular account.\n\nThe [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) has a command to gather this information for you, in a format that is easy to cut/paste into the `vlan.tfvars` properties file.\n\n- Install the IGC CLI\n\n- Log in to IBM Cloud using its CLI\n\n- Run the VLAN command\n    ```bash\n    igc vlan\n    ```\n- Copy the output values from the CLI Command into your `vlan.tfvars` files and **Save** and continue\n\n</Tab>\n\n\n<Tab label=\"Run\">\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nRun the scripts that create the environment\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nHaving configured the `credentials.properties`, `environment.tfvars`, and `vlan.tfvars` properties files, \nwe are now ready to kick off the installation.\n\n- Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cli-tools \"Cloud Garage Tools Docker image\").\n\n    Run the following command to run the Docker container:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh\n    ```\n\n    This will install the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image and exec shell into the running container. The container will \n    mount the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/`. Once the Docker container has started and \n    the script has exec shelled into it, you will see an IBM Garage banner. This will help you identify you are running \n    inside the Docker image that has just mounted your file system.\n\n    For more information on the **Developer Tools Image** see the following guide link below.\n\n- Create the <Globals name=\"env\" />\n\n    The supplied Terraform script is ready to run using the settings in the properties files. \n    You optionally can extend or modify the scripts and tailor them for your project's specific needs.\n\n    Run this script in the container:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n\n    This script will create the <Globals name=\"env\" />.\n    \n    If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still\n    exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if\n    you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete\n    the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit.\n\n    The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes), \n    the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.\n    \n    Both of the prompts can be skipped via command-line arguments passed to the script. To bypass the workspace\n    prompt, provided either `--delete` or `--keep` to either delete or keep the workspace, respectively. To\n    bypass the verification prompt provide `--auto-approve` and the script will automatically answer `Yes` to\n    the prompt and start the terraform process.\n\n    Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer) \n    and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes.\n\n    <InlineNotification kind=\"success\">\n\n    You should now have your <Globals name=\"env\" /> fully provisioned and configured. Enjoy!\n\n    </InlineNotification>\n\n\n\n### <Globals name=\"env\" />\n\nOnce the Terraform scripts have finished, you can see the resources that the scripts created in IBM Cloud:\n- In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#dashboardview \"Managing resources in the resource list\")\n- On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group (e.g. `appdev-team`)\n- You should see these resources listed:\n    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift\n    - **Services**: 5 or so, such as PostgreSQL, LogDNA, etc.\n    - **Storage**: 1, an instance of Cloud Object Storage\n- Select the cluster and open the Kubernetes dashboard or OpenShift web console. You should see:\n    - Namespaces: `tools`, `dev`, `test`, and `staging`\n    - Deployments in the `tools` namespace: `developer-dashboard`, `jenkins`, etc.\n\nTo get started with code use the following guides:\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/getting-started-day-1/deploy-app\">Deploy First App</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/tools\">Guides</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"/tools/tools-image\">Developer Tools Image</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n### Possible issues\n\nIf you find that that the Terraform provisioning has failed, try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again. \nThe state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.\n\nIf you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, you can try this:\n- Manually delete the service instances in your resource group\n- Delete the `workspace` directory (which will remove any state that has been created by Terraform)\n- Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script\n    ```bash\n    rm -rf workspace\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/ibm-garage-developer-guide/ibm-garage-developer-guide/src/pages/admin/installation-ibm-cloud/index.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","3273249464","63531786","63531786","768070550"]}
