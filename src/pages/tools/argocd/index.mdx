Use GitOps to continuously deliver application changes

</PageDescription>

[Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is a declarative, [GitOps](/getting-started-day-0/git-ops) [continuous delivery](/getting-started-day-2/continuous-delivery) 
tool for Kubernetes. The deployment environment is a namespace in a container platform like <Globals name="kube" /> or <Globals name="ocp" />. 
Argo CD models a collection of applications as a project and uses a Git repository to store the application's desired state. 
Argo CD is flexible in the structure of the application configuration represented in the Git repository.

Argo CD supports defining Kubernetes manifests in a number of ways:
- helm charts
- kustomize
- ksonnet
- jsonnet
- plain directory of yaml/json manifests
- custom plugins

Argo CD compares the actual state of the application in the cluster with the desired state defined in Git and determines if
they are out of sync. When it detects the environment is out of sync, Argo CD can be configured to either send out a 
notification to kick off a separate reconciliation process or Argo CD can automatically synchronize the environments to 
ensure they match.

**Note:** Confidential information like passwords and security tokens should not be checked into the Git repository. [Managing secrets in Argo CD](#managing-secrets-in-argo-cd)
provides information on how to handle confidential information in the GitOps repo.

## Configuring GitOps with Argo CD

**Terminology:**

Argo CD uses a number of terms to refer to the components

- Application - A deployable unit

    In the context of the <Globals name="env" />, an application is one Helm chart that contains one container image 
    that was produced by one CI pipeline. While Helm charts and images could certainly be combined to make more 
    sophisticated applications in more advanced scenarios, we will be using this simple definition here.
    
- Project - A collection of applications that make up a solution

### Set up the GitOps repo

Argo CD uses a Git repo to express the desired state of the Kubernetes environment. The basic setup uses one 
repository to represent one [*project*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/projects/). Within that 
repository, each [*application*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications) 
that makes up the project will be described in its own folder. The repository will also contain a branch for each 
destination (i.e. cluster and namespace) into which we want to deploy the applications.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** There is nothing special about a git repository used for git-ops. All that is required at a minimum is a hosted git
repository that is accessible from by the Argo CD instance.  The [Argo CD <Globals name="template" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate) 
used in the following steps is optional and provides some application templates to help simplify some configuration activities.

</InlineNotification>

1. Create a new repo from the [Argo CD <Globals name="template" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate)

1. Clone the project to your machine

1. Create a branch for the environment (e.g. `test` to configure the values for deployment to the testing environment)

    ```shell script
    git checkout -b test
    ```

1. Push the test branch up to the repository

    ```shell script
    git push -u origin test
    ```

### Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline

The last stage in the CI pipeline updates a GitOps repository with the updated application metadata from the build. In
order to do that, the CI pipeline needs to know which repository should be used and needs the credentials to push changes
to that repository. As with other configuration within the pipeline, this is handled with config maps and secrets:

- A secret named `git-credentials` holds the credentials the CI pipeline uses to access all the respositories in the Git host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc).
If you used the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to register the pipeline then this secret has already been created.
- A secret named `gitops-repo` holds the url and branch for the gitops repository.

Fortunately the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) provides a `gitops` command to simplify this step. Information on how to use the
command as well as the alternative manual steps can be found in the [IGC CLI gitops command](/getting-started/cli#gitops) section.

1. Run the `gitops` command to create the config map and secret in the CI namespace

    ```shell script
    igc gitops
    ```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**

- For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace where the 
pipeline is running.
- The value provided for `branch` is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger the CD 
pipeline.

</InlineNotification>

As of v2.0.0 of the Tekton tasks and the Jenkins pipelines, the CI pipeline will create a folder and the initial configuration
for an application deployment if it doesn't already exist. This means, there is no other manual configuration required
to set up the repository.

### Create a project in Argo CD (Optional)

In Argo CD terms, each deployable component is an application and applications are grouped into projects. Projects are not
required for Argo CD to be able to deploy applications, but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions
on what can be done for applications that make up a project.

1. Log into the Argo CD user interface

1. Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options

    ![Argo CD config](/images/argocd-config.png)

1. Select the Projects option

1. Press the New Project button at the top of the page

1. Specify the properties for the new project

    - Name - Provide the name for the project
    - Description - A brief description of the project
    - Source - Press Add source and pick the Git repository from the list that was added previously
    - Destinations
        - Add `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the cluster url and `test` for the namespace
        - Add `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the cluster url and `staging` for the namespace
    - Press Create

    **Note:** Initially, the only cluster that is available is the one in which Argo CD is -
    `https://kubernetes.default.svc`. By adding the two destinations we have allowed the project to be deployed
    to both the `test` and `staging` namespaces within the current cluster.

### Managing secrets in Argo CD

The following provides the steps to handle protected information in a GitOps repository using the
[Argo CD Key Protect plugin](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect). The plugin takes yaml 
configuration as input, looks up the credentials in Key Protect, and generates a secret in the cluster from the results.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** If Argo CD was installed via the Toolkit then the plugin should already be installed and ready to use. If not, the 
instructions for installing the plugin can be found in the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect).

</InlineNotification>

#### Prepare the Key Protect instance

As the name suggests, the [Argo CD Key Protect plugin](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect) leverages the
capabilities of the Key Protect service to manage the protected information. The details for setting up and
managing the Key Protect instance can be found in [Secret management with Key Protect](/tools/secret-management-with-key-protect). From
those instructions you can find the information required for the subsequent steps.

#### Create the secret configuration

The input to the plugin is a directory that contains one or more yaml "secret templates". In this case the "secret template" provides the 
structure of the desired secret with placeholders for the values that will be pulled from the key management system. 

1. Create a directory to contain the secret configuration. The [Argo CD <Globals name="template" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops) repository has a template in `templates/secrets-plugin` that can be copied as a starting point

2. Update the values in the yaml file for the secret that will be created

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: keymanagement.ibm/v1
    kind: SecretTemplate
    metadata:
      name: mysecret
      annotations:
        key-manager: key-protect
        key-protect/instanceId: instance-id
        key-protect/region: us-east
    spec:
      labels: {}
      annotations: {}
      values:
        - name: url
          value: https://ibm.com
        - name: username
          b64value: dGVhbS1jYXA=
        - name: password
          keyId: 36397b07-d98d-4c0b-bd7a-d6c290163684
    ``` 
    
    - The `metadata.annotations` value is optional. 
    
        - `key-manager` - the only value supported currently is `key-protect`
        - `key-protect/instanceId` - the instance id of the key protect instance. If not provided then the `instance-id` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.
        - `key-protect/region` - the region where the key protect instance has been provisioned. If not provided then the `region` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.
        
    - The `metadata.name` value given will be used as the name for the Secret that will be generated.
    - The information in `spec.labels` and `spec.annotations` will be copied over as the `labels` and `annotations` in the Secret that is generated
    - The `spec.values` section contains the information that should be provided in the `data` section of the generated Secret. There are three prossible ways the values can be provided:
    
        - `value` - the actual value can be provided directly as clear text. This would be appropriate for information that is not sensitive but is required in the secret
        - `b64value` - a base64 encoded value can be provided to the secret. This can be used for large values that might present formatting issues or for information that is not sensitive but that might be obfuscated a bit (like a username)
        - `keyId` - the id (not the name) of the Standard Key that has been stored in Key Protect. The value stored in Key Protect can be anything

3. Commit the changes to the GitOps repository

#### Add the secret application in Argo CD

Once the configuration has been added to the GitOps repository, Argo CD needs to be configured to deploy the secrets.

### Configure another cluster as an Argo CD deployment target

Argo CD supports deploying applications into clusters other than the one into which it has been installed. To do that,
the target cluster must first be registered with Argo CD. After that, the cluster api server can be selected as a
deployment target within an application configuration. The following describes the steps required to add another cluster
as a deployment target:

1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI

    ```shell script
    argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]
    ```
    
    where:
    
    - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On <Global name="ocp" /> this is the same as the UI host
    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for
    the username and password
    
    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command

2. Log into the target cluster from the command line

3. Run the Argo CD command to list the available clusters 

    ```shell script
    argocd cluster add
    ```
    
    The currently selected cluster will be the one with the asterisk next to it. Copy the cluster id from the table

4. Add the cluster to Argo CD

    ```shell script
    argocd cluster add {CLUSTER ID}
    ```
   
    where:
    
    - `{CLUSTER ID}` is the id of the target cluster from the previous step

5. Confirm the configuration by listing the known clusters

    ```shell script
    argocd cluster list
    ```

### Authentication to ArgoCD with AppId

#### Register the application client in AppId

1. Open the AppId console

2. Click on `Applications` from the left menu

3. Press the `Add application` button

4. Provide a name for the application and the following values for scopes

    - groups
    - email
    - profile

5. Press `Save` to create the application client

6. Select the created application from the table and expand the section to view the configuration values

7. Make note of the `oAuthServerUrl`, `clientId`, and `secret`. They will be used later to configure ArgoCD

#### Update the ArgoCD configuration

1. Find the ArgoCD CR for the ArgoCD instance

    ```shell script
    kubectl get argocd -A
    ```

2. Edit the ArgoCD instance

    ```shell script
    kubectl edit argocd {argocd-name}
    ```

3. Update the ArgoCD instance configuration with the following dex config

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ArgoCD
    metadata:
      name: argocd
    spec:
      dex:
        config: |
          connectors:
            - id: appid
              name: appid
              type: oidc
              config:
                issuer: {ISSUER_URL}
                clientID: {CLIENT_ID}
                clientSecret: {CLIENT_SECRET}
                redirectURI: {ARGOCD_BASE_URL}/api/dex/callback
    ```

    where:
        - `{ISSUER_URL}` is the AppId `oAuthServerUrl` for the application client
        - `{CLIENT_ID}` is the AppId `clientId` for the application client
        - `{CLIENT_SECRET}` is the AppId `secret` for the application client
        - `{ARGOCD_BASE_URL}` is the url from the ArgoCD route to the ArgoCD server

#### Register the ArgoCD callback url with AppId

1. Open the AppId console

2. Select `Manage Authentication` from the left menu

3. Select the `Authentication Settings` tab

4. Add the `redirectURI` from above to the "Add web redirect URLs" section
